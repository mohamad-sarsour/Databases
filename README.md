## “FStats” is database of a website that holds information about football matches, players, and more.In FStats, users with admin privileges can add a match, player, stadium and so on, in addition FStats is a smart service that gives statistics about football in general.
###### my mission was to design the database and implement (using SQL) the data access layer of the system. Typically, the data access layer facilitates the interaction of other components of the system with the database by providing a simplified API that carries out a predefined desired set of operations. A function in the API may receive library objects as Input arguments. These are regular Python classes that hold special semantic meaning in the context of the application (typically, all other system components are familiar with them).
